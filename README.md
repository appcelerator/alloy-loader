# alloy-loader

Webpack loader for [Alloy](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy) components.

> ⚠️ Note: This loader is meant to be used exclusively in projects powered by [appcd-plugin-webpack](https://github.com/appcelerator/appcd-plugin-webpack) and does not consider external usages.

The Appcd Webpack plugin will automatically configure this loader when the project type is set to `alloy` inside the `webpack` section of your `tiapp.xml`.
